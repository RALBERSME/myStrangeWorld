          Cliff Young was born in 1922 in Victoria, Australia. <br />He grew up
          on a sheep farm and, as a child, had to round up the cattle (2,000
          sheep) on foot because the family could not afford horses. After his
          father's death, he and his brother took over the farm. <br /><br />At
          the age of 61, he signed up for an ultramarathon from Westfield Sydney
          to Melbourne, covering a distance of 544 miles (approximately 875
          kilometers). He had prepared for this race for a long time. But when
          he competed in 1983, dressed in potato farmer's work clothes and
          rubber boots, he was met with only pitying smiles. Due to his slow
          pace, all the other runners quickly overtook him, and he fell further
          and further behind. After just the first day, he was many miles behind
          the others. Nevertheless, he would soon prove everyone wrong.<br /><br />
          Cliff ran for five days, 15 hours, and 4 minutes. Then he reached the
          finish line. He won the race by a day and a half over his competitors.

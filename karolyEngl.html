        Károly Takács<br /><br />
        was born in Budapest in 1910. In 1936, he joined the Hungarian army. He
        had become a pistol champion and dreamed of winning an Olympic gold
        medal. This dream, however, was shattered when his place on the
        Hungarian team was given to a major, while Korolev was only a sergeant.
        <br /><br />
        He decided to become so good that he couldn't be ignored next time. He
        subsequently became a member of the Hungarian rifle team. He was now
        considered the favorite for the gold medal at the next Olympic Games.
        <br /><br />
        But another blow of fate awaited him. In 1938, due to the grenade
        launcher's carelessness, a grenade exploded in his hand , causing him to
        lose his right shooting hand.
        <br /><br />

        Károly, however, still dreams of an Olympic medal so much that he began
        secretly training with his other hand. He trained and trained and became
        very proficient with that hand as well.
        <br /><br />
        In 1939, he arrived at the Hungarian Athletics Championships and met the
        other shooters, who looked at him and expressed their sympathy.
        <br />
        "We were so sad about your accident, but we love your fighting spirit
        and I appreciate you coming to cheer us on," one competitor greeted him.
        <br />
        "I'm not here to talk to you," Károly replied, "I'm here to compete
        against you."
        <br />
        They laughed at him. But Károly astonished the audience by hitting the
        bull's eye in every event of the 25-meter rapid-fire pistol shooting and
        winning the gold medal.
        <br /><br />
        Now he was considered the favorite for the next Olympic Games. But then
        World War II broke out and the Olympic Games were canceled. Károly still
        dreamed of a gold medal at the Olympics. The next Olympic Games weren't
        held until 1948. They took place in London. Károly traveled there as
        part of the Hungarian team. By now, he was no longer considered the
        favorite.
        <br /><br />
        A successful one-handed shooter looked at him condescendingly and said:
        "You're 38 years old, what do you still hope to win here?"
        <br />
        Károly paid no attention to his words. He knew what he was capable of.
        <br />
        With 580 points, nine points ahead of the Argentinian world champion and
        world record holder, he won the competition. He not only won the gold
        medal, but also broke the world record in 25-meter rapid fire pistol
        shooting.
        <br /><br />
        But he showed that he was capable of even more. In 1952, he again won
        the Olympic gold medal in Helsinki with 579 points.
        <br /><br />
        Even four years later, he competed again in the 1956 Olympics. This
        time, he took eighth place in Melbourne with 575 points. Finally, he
        also won a bronze medal at the 1958 World Championships.
        <br /><br />
        He had many reasons to give up, but his will to win was greater.

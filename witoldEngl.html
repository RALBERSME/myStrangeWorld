        <h2>Witold Pilecki was born in 1901 in the Russian Empire.</h2>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          His family was forcibly resettled there because his grandfather had
          participated in the January Uprising. During World War I, he joined a
          Polish self-defense unit.
          <br /><br />Between 1919 and 1920, he participated in the
          Polish-Soviet War. Later, he joined the Polish Army. He was twice
          awarded the Cross of the Brave for his bravery. <br /><br />In
          November 1939, he founded one of the first underground organizations
          in Nazi-occupied Poland. In 1940, he allowed himself to be infiltrated
          into Auschwitz I concentration camp as a prisoner to investigate what
          was going on there. <br /><br />At that time, little was known about
          German activities in the camp. It was considered an internment camp.
          As prisoner number 4859, he continued to organize the defense
          underground. His plan was an internal uprising within the camp.
          Through him and his organization, information from the camp got out.
          He was also able to smuggle food and clothing into the camp for the
          inmates. <br /><br />Through the resistance group ZOW, â€‹his reports
          reached the British government in London. When his hopes for Allied
          intervention diminished, while the aggression of the Nazis in the
          concentration camp and throughout Poland increased, he decided to
          escape from the camp. During a night shift in the camp bakery, he and
          two comrades managed to escape with documents that he had stolen from
          the Germans. He wrote a detailed report on the conditions in the
          Auschwitz concentration camp.

          <br /><br />In 1947, Pilecki was accused by the Soviet occupiers of
          Poland of spying for the Western Allies and executed ten days later.
          His grave has never been found. It is presumed that he was buried in a
          garbage dump near Warsaw.<br /><br />

        The newspaper advertised the Baramati Marathon, which was about to take
        place and whose winners would receive a large prize.
        <br /><br />Lata had hardly any time to prepare. Every day, she trained
        by running up the mountain with two buckets of water, dodging sharp
        stones and uneven terrain. Soon, she, too, was at the start of the
        Baramati Marathon.<br /><br />
        Unlike the other participants, she didn't have any athlete shoes or
        functional clothing. She wore a saree (traditional Indian clothing) and,
        at her advanced age of 65, wanted to run barefoot. The organizers argued
        with her because this did not comply with the prescribed dress code. But
        Lata pleaded with them until the organizers finally relented.
        <br /><br />The marathon began, and Lata ran as fast as she could. The
        hard gravel on the path tore her feet, causing them to bleed. But she
        kept running. During the marathon, her concentration was driven by her
        love for her husband and the goal of winning the necessary amount. They
        needed the money so badly.

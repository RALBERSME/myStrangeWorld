        The unbelievable happened.<br /><br />
        Lata won the marathon. She received tremendous applause. No one had
        expected such a feat from her grandmother. She used the prize money of
        5,000 Indian rupees for her husband's medical treatment.<br /><br />This
        running competition in 2013 was her first marathon. Since then, she has
        regularly participated in marathons and used her winnings for her
        family's needs.<br /><br />
        Her story was immortalized in the Marathi film "Lata Bhagwan Kare,"
        which won an award at the National Film Awards.

        After graduating from high school, László Polgár initially worked as a
        welder, but then took evening classes in pedagogy and psychology. He
        then began working as a drawing and ethics teacher at a middle
        school.<br /><br />
        His theory was that talents are not innate, but rather learned. He was
        guided by the writings of the American psychologist John B. Watson.
        <br /><br />When his three daughters were born in 1969, 1974, and 1976,
        he wanted to prove this. He wanted to demonstrate that children are
        capable of exceptional achievements from a very early age if they are
        systematically and intensively supported. <br /><br />
        For this reason, he and his wife began to homeschool their children. He
        chose chess as the subject of training, as achievements in this area can
        be easily evaluated based on tournament results. To challenge his
        daughters even more, he had them compete primarily in men's tournaments.
        <br /><br />And indeed, his daughters became known as the chess
        prodigies Zsuzsa, Zsófia, and Judit Polgár. They all achieved
        significant titles: <br />
        Zsuzsa was World Champion and Grandmaster, Zsófia was Women's
        International Master and Women's Grandmaster, and Judit is the only
        woman to reach the top ten in the world rankings and is considered the
        strongest female chess player in history.

        Lata Bhagwan Kare lived with her family in a small village in
        Maharashtra, India. Although she and her husband had worked hard all
        their lives, they lived in poverty. They had spent all their savings on
        marrying off their daughters. When the daughters left home, Lata and her
        husband began working as daily laborers on farms in the area. But even
        this salary was barely enough to survive.<br /><br />
        Lata's husband fell ill and was diagnosed with a serious infection. Lata
        wanted to take her husband to the hospital, but she lacked the money for
        the treatment. She asked everyone she knew to support her. So she begged
        friends, neighbors, and relatives and collected money for further health
        tests. This made it possible for her husband to undergo initial medical
        tests.<br /><br />
        But the doctors pointed out that further tests and medication would be
        necessary, which would cost more money. Lata began to despair. She had
        already begged everyone. Where would she get more money?<br /><br />
        On her way home, she passed a street food vendor and received two
        samosas (Indian junk food) wrapped in a newspaper. Her eyes fell on an
        article in the newspaper, and what she read gave her new hope.

        In 2004, the media reported on the major Phuket tsunami in Thailand.
        Around 230,000 people died. The tsunami was triggered by an undersea
        earthquake off the coast of Sumatra and led to one of the deadliest
        natural disasters in the coastal regions. Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India,
        Somalia, and Thailand were particularly affected. People were too
        surprised by the waves to escape....

        Tilly Smith was still a schoolchild at the time. But just two weeks
        before her vacation in Phuket, she had paid close attention in geography
        class. At that time, the teacher had explained the nature of a tsunami,
        and Tilly recognized precisely these signs, such as the receding sea.
        She immediately alerted her parents, whereupon her father had other
        beachgoers and hotel staff wait. The beach was immediately cleared.
        Through her vigilance, she saved the lives of around 100 people.
